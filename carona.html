                <h1>COVID-19</h1>
                <P>Caronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</P>
                <p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough,fever,and in more serve cases,difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently,avoiding touching your face,and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell </p>
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, but it can also present as a wide range of other symptoms or even be asymptomatic in some cases. The virus can affect individuals of all ages, but it poses a higher risk for older adults and those with underlying health conditions. In response to the pandemic, public health measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, quarantine, and lockdowns have been implemented to slow the virus's spread and protect vulnerable populations.</p>

These droplets carry the virus and can infect individuals who are in close proximity to the infected person, typically within about 6 feet or 2 meters. The risk of transmission is especially high in indoor settings with limited ventilation. </p>
